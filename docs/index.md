# Getting started with parrot :parrot:

parrot is designed to process continuously recorded THz traces from a THz-TDS.
parrot can process the raw, continuous measurement data (consisting of time, position of the delay stage, and the THz
signal) and retrieves an averaged, high quality THz trace with access to interpolated individual traces as well as
further
statistics.

To achieve this goal, parrot is divided into three main classes:

1. [Load](./load.md)

2. [Process](./process.md)

3. [Plot](./plot.md)

You can also find the corresponding documentation for each class also in the header above.

The program is released as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), written by Tim Vogel at the Photonics and Ultrafast
Laser Science (PULS) group at the Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.
